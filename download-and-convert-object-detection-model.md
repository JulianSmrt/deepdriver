# Download and convert object detection model

The DeepDriver project is an application built on top of the existing AWS DeepRacer application which uses an object detection machine learning model through which the AWS DeepRacer device can identify traffic signs. More details about the DeepDriver project and the components can be found [here](https://github.com/jochem725/deepdriver).

## Download the model
Instructions for downloading the required machine learning model can be found in the [Follow the Leader(FTL) sample project repository](https://github.com/aws-deepracer/aws-deepracer-follow-the-leader-sample-project/blob/main/download-and-convert-object-detection-model.md).

We recommend using [ssdlite_mobilenet_v2](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_models_model_ssdlite_mobilenet_v2.html) for faster inference.
